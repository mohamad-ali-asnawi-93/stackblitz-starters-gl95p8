# Numbers are integers
  
_This is an example! Don't have to type the code_

Integers are whole numbers. This is an example:

```javascript
const age = 69;
```

_This is an example! Don't have to type the code_

We can also print the value of variables with numbers as well:
```javascript
console.log(age)
```
This will show `69` in console.


_This is an example! Don't have to type the code_

You can use math operators such as addition, subtraction.


```javascript
const age = 69;
const thisYear = 2021;
const yearBorn = thisYear - age;
console.log(yearBorn);
```

It should print out `1952`.

## Exercise
1. Create variable `height` and assigned it to `175`.

2. Create another variable `idealHeight` assigned it to `185`.

3. Create another variable `difference` assigned it to the difference of the `height` variable and `idealHeight` variable.
4. Console log `difference`

In console, it should look like this: 

```
10
```
